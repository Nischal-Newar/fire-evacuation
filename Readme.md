# Dynamic Escape Route Finder for Fire Evacuation

This project is focused on creating a dynamic escape route finder using the A* algorithm and Q-learning. 
The primary objective is to assist in fire evacuation scenarios by intelligently determining optimal escape routes.

## Instructions for Execution
To run the program, execute the main.py file. 
The code has been developed using PyCharm, ensuring a smooth development and execution environment. 
However, please note that there might be issues with image imports,
necessitating adjustment of image file locations if errors are encountered.

## Technologies and Algorithms Utilized
**A-Star Algorithm:**
The project incorporates the A-Star algorithm, a popular pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm,
to efficiently compute optimal escape routes in the event of a fire.

**Q-learning:**
Leveraging reinforcement learning principles, Q-learning enhances the system's ability to adapt dynamically, 
continuously improving escape route decisions based on experience.

## Running the Program
Execute the main.py file to initiate the escape route finder.
Follow any on-screen instructions for input or customization,
and observe the system's intelligent determination of the optimal escape path.

## Development Environment
This project was developed using PyCharm, ensuring a streamlined coding and debugging experience. 
It is recommended to use a compatible IDE for optimal results.

## Image Import Considerations
Adjust the file paths for image imports if errors are encountered. 
Ensure that image files are correctly located to enable proper functioning of the program.

## Contributing and Feedback
Contributions and feedback are welcome. 
Feel free to submit issues or suggestions to enhance the functionality and reliability of the escape route finder.
